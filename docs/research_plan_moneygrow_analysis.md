# Research Plan: MoneyGrow Platform Codebase Analysis

## Objectives
- Conduct a comprehensive audit of the MoneyGrow platform codebase.
- Identify all missing components, incomplete functionality, and configuration issues.
- Provide a prioritized roadmap for development and actionable recommendations for completion.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Codebase Exploration and Initial Analysis**
  - Task 1.1: List all files and directories within the `user_input_files/moneygrow/` directory.
  - Task 1.2: Analyze the project structure and identify key modules.
- **Phase 2: Core Component Analysis**
  - Task 2.1: Review `src/analyzers` for ML and heuristic analysis engine completeness.
  - Task 2.2: Review `src/data` for data collection and integration logic.
  - Task 2.3: Review `src/models` for database schemas and API models.
  - Task 2.4: Review `src/api` for FastAPI endpoint implementation.
  - Task 2.5: Review `src/tasks` for background task processing.
  - Task 2.6: Review `src/config` for configuration management.
- **Phase 3: Missing Components and Dependencies**
  - Task 3.1: Identify empty or placeholder directories (`frontend/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `ml/`).
  - Task 3.2: Analyze `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
  - Task 3.3: Analyze `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for environment setup.
- **Phase 4: Code Quality and Security Assessment**
  - Task 4.1: Check for error handling and logging implementation across the codebase.
  - Task 4.2: Assess code structure, organization, and potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Phase 5: Synthesis and Reporting**
  - Task 5.1: Consolidate all findings into a structured analysis.
  - Task 5.2: Create a development priority matrix.
  - Task 5.3: Generate the final analysis report.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most critical missing components that prevent the system from being functional?
2. What are the main code quality issues and technical debt?
3. What is the recommended order of development to make the platform production-ready?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: The provided codebase in `/workspace/user_input_files/moneygrow/`.
- Tools: `list_workspace`, `file_read`.

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: The analysis will be based on the provided source code.
- Cross-validation: N/A, as this is a code review task.

## Expected Deliverables
- A detailed analysis report in markdown format.
- A prioritized development roadmap.
- Actionable recommendations for each identified issue.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search (in this case, code exploration and analysis).
- Justification: The task requires a deep dive into the codebase to identify issues and create a plan, which aligns with the search-focused workflow.
